# License-Plate-Recognition-Challenge-AI-hack-Tunisia-2019-

Requirements
 Tensorflow 1.4 
 OpenCV
 keras 2.2.0
 Common packages such as scikit-learn, numpy and so on.
 
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset (28*28 images)


Further improvements can be made by chaging the dataset, as the font of the digits(handwritten and  FE-Schrift) dosen't match wich leads to errors in recogniton (most occurences for the numbers 7/1 )
